The software has shown really good results, the program was capable to catch strange IP addresses. We could simply test this by deleting some IP addresses from the IP addresses whitelist and just run the system as usually, and when the IP addresses appear on the network, the system tries to find those addresses on the local whitelist. As expected those addresses are not found on the whitelist and as a wanted reaction the system sends a warning telling that there is a strange IP address trying to communicate over the server or to one of the edges. In this way, we could simulate a life environment where an IP address which is not known is trying to gain communication with one of Raalabs IOT edges. Moreover we have spoofed some new mac addresses to the system, we stimulated those new mac addresses to try to talk to the system. The system has discovered those intruders and told us about them by sending warnings that are both logged to the console, a log file and to a database. However those intruders could gain communication as our system is meant to be a detection system not a firewall. The system also could shown when the states are changing in an unallowed way
